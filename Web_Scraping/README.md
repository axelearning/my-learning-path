# Scrape high school data 📚

scrape [Schoolmouv's](https://www.schoolmouv.fr) website to get the title of each chapter in high school.

- the final [JSON file](#chapters.json)
- the [script](#main.py)

```
iterate over each years:
    iterate over each subject:
        initialize an empty list
        iterate over each chapter:
            save the chapter title
```
