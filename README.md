# üë®‚Äçüíª MY PROJECTS

A collection of selected projects to demonstrate skill sets, knowledge, and what I find interesting
<br>

## Get the Data

- **[SQL]()**, querry a database to solve a mystery,
- **[Web Scrapping]()**, a script used to collect data on soccer players using `beautifullsoup` and `selenium`
  <br>

## Data Analysis

- **[Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/axelito974/data-exploration-with-python)**, explore the house price dataset (79 features) using `pandas` and `Matplolib`
- **Data Preparation & Visualisation**, create an app with impactfull visualisation using `Plotly` and `Dash`:
  - [COVID19 dashboard project](https://github.com/axelearning/covid19_dashboard)
  - [Sale Analysis](https://github.com/axelearning/sale_analysis)
    <br>

## Machine Learning

- [Apply Deep Learning on Fish](https://github.com/axelearning/fish_and_chips), a web application that will recognize fish in the Reunion Island lagoon. App build with `Fast ai` and `Streamlit`
  <!-- - [Advanced Regression Techniques](), used advanced regression technique to predict the price of an house -->
    <br>
    <br>

## Back End Dev

- a **[REST API](https://github.com/axelearning/REST-authentication-API)** buit to manage user authentication with Django. SOme interesting parts:
  - [Build an API](https://github.com/axelearning/REST-authentication-API) using `django` and `dj_rest_framework`
  - [PythonOOP](https://github.com/axelearning/REST-authentication-API/tree/master/authentication/helper), an exemple of my object orented skill with `python`
  - [Test-driven development](https://github.com/axelearning/REST-authentication-API/tree/master/tests/tests_authentication), an example of a batch of tests used to drive the API development
    <br>
    <br>

## In progress üöß

- Building a low code tool with [Naas](https://github.com/jupyter-naas) to let user easily interact with Notion API
  <br>
